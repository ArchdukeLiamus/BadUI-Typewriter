# BadUI-Typewriter
r/badUIbattles: Notepad but with typewriter behavior

Type to... type, drag the window to move the cursor. Typewriters are mechanical; be sure to leave room for the carriage to move.

You need a modern Java to run this. The menu bar is just for looks, it does nothing.
Use at your own risk. I assume no liability.
